          <h1>Leaf Project</h1>
          <p>Leaf is a mobile application designed to raise awareness of your carbon footprint on the environment.

            This was created as part of a weekend hackathon organized by Girl Geek Sydney and Canva, with the objective being to come up with an idea to solve for the theme 'Write the Future'.</p>

      <h2>Quote</h2>
      <p>Our house is falling apart, and we are rapidly running out of time -Greta Thunberg speech to EU Parliament - 2019</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Greta Thunberg is one of the many individuals of our generation concerned about the future of our planet and the need for immediate action to combat climate change. As part of the weekend hackathon, my team and I wanted to tackle this issue and raise awareness of how individuals can contribute to lessening their impact on the environment through simple daily tasks.</p>

  <h2>Leaf won the Best Experience Design award</h2>

  <p>I was the sole designer on the team alongside 1 business analyst and 4 engineers. I was responsible for the product design and UX/UI experience for the app. Whilst the hackathon was short, some key achievements listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applied design sprints to inform our process</li>
    <li>Executed end to end.</li>
    <li>Won the design award.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>

  <p>I conducted a brainstorming workshop with the team to uncover pains felt by individuals. It was revealed that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Individuals were unaware of their direct impact of their water, electricity and consumption on the environment</li>
    <li>Individuals wanted to take action on reducing their carbon footprint but didn't know where to begin</li>
    <li>Individuals would be more conscious of their actions if their impact was quantifiable and measurable</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Product vision and solution</h2>

  <h2>Defining the MVP</h2>

  <h2>Designs</h2>
  <p>With the clock ticking, I quickly did some mockups of the basic user journey before going over it with the desired styling. I opted for a refreshing gradient look and the simplicity of the UI.  I then created for the developers a clickable prototype in Invision.</p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
<p>I used Invision to allow the engineers to inspect the HTML and CSS of the designs. The team used Glitch to develop the application and the app was built using React. It is accessible via the web and on native iOS app.</p>
  <h2>Results and takeaways</h2>
 <p>We were able to successfully implement 75% of the designs and delivered a presentation at the end of the hackathon to a panel of judges. We took home the Best Experience and Design Award at the end of the night.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Girl Geek Sydney and Canva, I had a really enjoyable experience at this hackathon. I was extremely fortunate to have worked with some incredibly bright and talented female engineers and business analysts to come up with a product in a short period of time.</p>
